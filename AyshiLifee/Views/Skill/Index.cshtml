            <strong>I love reading fan fiction books because they let me dive deeper into the stories and characters I already enjoy.</strong>
            It’s like the world never ends—there’s always something new, unexpected, or exciting to explore.
            Fan fiction gives me a break from reality and fuels my imagination, and I love how creative and passionate the writers are.
            It’s a whole community built on shared love for stories.

        <strong>I’ve always had a passion for photography.</strong>
        I love capturing moments—little things others might miss—and turning them into something meaningful.
        Whether it’s nature, people, or everyday life, photography lets me see the world differently,
        and I’m proud of how good I’ve become at telling stories through my lens.
