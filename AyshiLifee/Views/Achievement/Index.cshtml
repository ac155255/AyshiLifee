    <p>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have actively participated in various scholastic and creative competitions, earning recognition at both school and national levels.
        I was honored to represent my school and secure first place in a nationwide competition in Fiji, and I have also been selected for numerous academic contests such as essay and art competitions, receiving distinctions for my writing.

    <p>
        In addition to academics, I am passionate about the arts, particularly drawing, where I express creativity across a wide range of subjects.
        I also enjoy reading, which continuously broadens my perspective and deepens my understanding of the world.

        Beyond the classroom, I am involved in community efforts alongside my sister, particularly in supporting stray animals through non-volunteering organizations.
        This work reflects my commitment to compassion, responsibility, and contributing meaningfully to society.
        I believe in continuous growth, service to others, and the power of education to shape both individual lives and communities.
