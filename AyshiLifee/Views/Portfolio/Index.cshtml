<h1 class="text-center mb-4">Heart for Strays</h1>

<div class="text-center">
    <p class="lead">
        Alongside my sister, I actively support stray and injured animals in our community through self-funded efforts.
        We provide food, basic medical care, and temporary shelter, and work to find permanent homes for rescued animals.
        Though not part of a formal organization, our work is driven by compassion and a commitment to animal welfare.

        I have a strong passion for visual arts, particularly in drawing and handmade crafts. My work includes sketching, painting, and creating unique DIY projects using various materials.
        These creative pursuits have helped me develop attention to detail, patience, and an eye for aesthetics. I often create personalized gifts, home decor items, and illustrations, combining creativity with practical design.

<!-- Section 3: Handmade Computer Models -->
<h1 class="text-center mb-4">Handmade Computer Models – School Department Showcase (Year 11)</h1>

<div class="text-center">
    <p class="lead">
        I created detailed handmade models of computer components using craft materials such as cardboard, paper, wires, and paint.
        These included models of a CPU, motherboard, keyboard, and internal hardware elements. The models were used to visually explain computer architecture to younger students and visitors.
        This project helped me combine creativity with technical knowledge, and it was appreciated for its accuracy and presentation.
