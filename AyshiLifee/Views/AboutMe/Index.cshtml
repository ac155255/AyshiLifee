    <h1>Hello, I’m Ayshi</h1>
    <p class="lead">Design Lover • Creative Thinker • Code Crafter</p>

    <p>
        My name is Ayshi Yuktha Kumar, and I am an 18-year-old student currently enrolled in Year 13 at Nadi SKM College. I am pursuing a combination of subjects that includes English, Mathematics, Economics, Computer Studies, and History, all of which align with my academic and career interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        I aspire to build a career as a Human Resource Manager, where I can combine my analytical skills, communication abilities, and passion for working with people to create positive and productive environments.

            <strong>I’m someone who values real connection.</strong>
            Whether it’s through the chaotic laughter of a tight friend group or the deep love I have for my mum, who inspires me every day.
            I believe in working hard and staying true to myself, which is why passing my Fiji Year 12 exams with good marks means so much—it reflects my dedication and drive.
            I carry the lessons of the past with me, the support of the people I love, and a strong belief that there’s so much more ahead.

            <strong>My mum is my biggest inspiration and truly everything to me.</strong>
            She’s the strongest, most selfless person I know—always putting others first and never giving up, no matter how hard things get.
            She’s taught me what love, resilience, and hard work really mean, just by the way she lives her life.
            Everything I am and everything I aim to be starts with her.

            <strong>We were a chaotic, funny group of seven</strong>—always loud, always laughing, and somehow always in trouble together.
            Every day felt like a new inside joke, and nothing was ever boring with us around.

        <p>
            <strong>Milo wasn’t just my dog—he was my best friend and a huge part of my childhood.</strong>
            He grew up with me, always by my side through every phase of life. What made Milo so special was how he seemed to understand everything, almost like a human.
            He knew when I was happy, sad, or needed someone, and he was always there with love and loyalty.
            Milo was friendly to everyone, but also protective, like he knew it was his job to look after us.
            His energy, love, and presence made every day brighter. He wasn’t just a dog—he was family, and I’ll always carry him in my heart.
